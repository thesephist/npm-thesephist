# npm-thesephist

This is a nice and memorable way to get my contact info (and other bits of data) from the command line with NPM. Idea shamelessly stolen from the legend [Jordan Scales](https://twitter.com/jdan), who in turn stoke the idea from [Justin Searls](https://github.com/searls).

## Use

`npm install thesephist` to get my contact info.

Once you have it installed, you can run `npm run postinstall` in the module or just run `./index.js` in the module.
